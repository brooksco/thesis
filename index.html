    Abstract
  </h2>

  <p>
    Digital literacy is increasingly understood to be a vital requirement for
    participation in modern society. At the same time, youth from diverse and
    disadvantaged backgrounds lack access to STEM fields and their associated
    educational pipelines. In this context, tools such as Processing and
    Scratch were developed to require less explicit in-school instruction, and
    to appeal to a wider variety of learners by closely coupling programming to
    artmaking. While the effectiveness of these creative coding tools with
    regards to teaching computer science and programming concepts has been
    studied fairly extensively, far less time has been spent considering the
    art produced through their use. Through an observation of projects created
    with Processing and Scratch and posted online, this paper explores the
    experience of artmaking through creative coding. Art generated through
    Processing and Scratch appears to engage with a broad variety of interests,
    passions, and differing purposes, potentially opening links to new
    audiences of learners. The tools and the community around them also reflect
    the wider share-everything mentality of the culture of making, and offer
    direct connections between physically separated artists. By expanding the
    idea of what constitutes a medium and drawing connections across
    disciplines, creative coding demonstrates a potential for reshaping not
    only art and technology education, but education itself.

  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Background to the problem</strong>
</p>
<p>
  As the internet and computing technologies have matured, so too has the
  understanding that digital literacy is a vital competency for participation
  in the new economy. At the same time, “new media” has become less    <em>new</em> and increasingly a label for a rapidly expanding area of
  artistic exploration and innovation. Technology inexorably marches on, and
  in doing so has continued to close the gap between the once separate
  spheres of computer science and the arts. New tools are allowing computer
  scientists to create art and artists to write code with less overhead, and
  greater conceptual overlap, while at the same time preparing both groups
  for the modern digital economy.
</p>
<p>
  STEAM, the integration of art into STEM education, is a recent and explicit
  argument that science, technology, engineering, and math are strengthened
  through a connection to the arts. In particular, STEAM offers the chance
  for increased opportunities in design and engineering fields (Martin, 2015,
  p.30), alongside the general benefits of a more holistic and inclusive
  education.
</p>
<p>
  One area where the arts, math, and technology are increasingly intertwined,
  is what is sometimes referred to as “creative coding.” Creative coding is
  hardly a formal term, but it has enough mindshare to be sprinkled
  throughout the literature (Greenberg, 2007; PBS, 2013), even if it lacks
  much in the way of firm academic definitions. That said, I would argue it
  is a practice characterized by utilizing computational, programmatic
  concepts and tools for creative, artistic pursuits. For the fields of
  computer science and mathematics, creative coding offers the chance to
  blunt the perceived difficulty and high drop-out rates that plague
  introductory computer science classes (Li and Watson, 2014). For artists,
  it is a chance for new forms of artistic expression, utilizing mathematics
  and data in a manner inaccessible outside of the computer.
</p>
<p>
  As the number of creative coding tools and languages continues to grow, so
  too does the number of tutorials, books, and videos available to those
  learning to use them. The technology and the support around creative coding
  has matured, while mainstream understanding and use of these tools is still
  limited, and so too is any deep understanding of what this means for future
  art making.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Problem statement</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Much of the research thus far on integrating the arts into STEM education
  has been focused around the tools as a means to do so. But as Robb &amp;
  Lauricella (2014) point out, this tool-first mentality starts breaking down
  in the context of modern technology such as iPads, where the apps
  themselves are such a variable part of the experience. The tools are
  increasingly not <em>themselves</em> the focus of educational efforts: it
  is the ideas around them.
</p>
<p>
  The tool-centric view of technology is especially outmoded when it comes to
  creative coding. Not because tools are not present, but because the nature
  of the tool is more distributed. Core coding concepts generally exist
  independently of any language or tool, and the surrounding environment,
  both technically and socially, is critical to the learning process.
  Overlooking the “community and mindset” as Martin (2015, p.37) put it, will
  almost certainly lead to failure.
</p>
<p>
  The experiential side of the ledger with regard to arts-centric technology
  has not been extensively considered. Part of the reason for this is likely
  the newness of creative coding as anything approaching a mainstream medium.
  Prior to the initial releases of tools such as Vvvv (1998), Processing
  (2002), openFrameworks (2005), Scratch (2007), and P5.js (2014), the
  options for someone attempting to code for art would have been much more
  limited and far less accessible. For learners new to coding, it would have
  been a practical impossibility. New technologies take time and effort to be
  adopted into the canon of education, and creative coding tools are no
  exception.
</p>
<p>
  A further complication is that these tools are flexible enough to be used
  for a variety of different ends, expanding the breadth of ways they could
  be studied. Processing alone is used for everything from data analytics, to
  game making, to interactive videos. Part of what makes creative coding
  tools so exciting also makes them hard to pin down. And curriculum
  surrounding these tools has yet to solidify, or exists merely as “old wine
  in new bottles” (Justice, 2015, p.131). In light of this, it should not be
  surprising that the research around creative coding is made up of arguably
  more holes than substance.
</p>
<p>
  MIT’s Scratch programming language has been studied more than most, but
  even that largely exists in the realm of research on the breadth and depth
  of participants’ coding abilities (Scaffidi &amp; Chambers, 2012; Matias,
  Dasgupta, &amp; Hill, 2016). As to the manner of artworks being created
  through these coding tools, there exists almost no formal research. The
  less quantifiable work of understanding the scope of what is being created
  has yet to be done.
</p>
<p>
  Another part of the reason for the lack of research in this area may be the
  cross-disciplinary competencies needed to perform it. Considering
  educational and creative coding tools in the light of art requires
  researchers to think both laterally—in the sense of how students are being
  introduced to the concept of coding—and forward—in the sense of the
  expanding purview of technological art making. Looking at art education in
  this way necessitates looking outside of the traditional arts classroom,
  and potentially outside of researchers’ own core competencies. The reality
  is that experts in both fields are few in number, and the research reflects
  that.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Primary research question</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Given that very little research has been done around the experience of
    creating art through creative coding tools such as Scratch and
    Processing, what can be learned about the kinds of artworks created by
    their users, through a study of their respective online communities?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Secondary research questions</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    How does the art created through visual coding tools differ from that
    of textual ones?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are the artistic trends or tendencies in creative coding online
    communities, and how do they differ from one another?
  </li>
  <li>
    In what ways does creating art with creative coding tools affect
    engagement in arts and coding communities?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Significance</strong>
</p>
<p>
  With the digital revolution showing few signs of slowing down, it is vital
  that we consider what this means for the creation of art. It is a laudable
  goal to push for creative coding and digital art creation on the basis of
  growing competency with technology, but the product of this effort is not
  just confined to downstream effects in STEM fields. The art and the
  experience of making the art are equally important, and may lead to further
  innovation and exploration, both technically and artistically. Creative
  coding means more than just creating a new generation of coders: it might
  mean a new generation of art.
</p>
<p>
  If “digital equity” (Peppler, 2010, p. 21) is to be achieved it is
  imperative that we understand what students are experiencing when they
  interact with new media technologies, and what they are creating. Too
  little has been done to analyze creative coding tools despite the
  increasing prevalence of their use, and it is past time for more research
  into this area. Better understanding the manner of art created through
  creative coding is vital to figuring out its role within the arts context,
  both now and going forward.
</p>

<h2 id="lit-review">
  Literature Review
</h2>

<p>
  Investigating the use of creative coding tools is a challenge for a number
  of reasons, not the least of which is their relative newness. A review of
  the literature surrounding art generated through software like Processing
  or Scratch is going to be piecemeal, and at times appear unrelated. Much of
  the current research is centered around studies on the use of these kinds
  of tools in introductory computer science classrooms (Dohn &amp; Wagner,
  1987; Malan &amp; Leitner, 2007), or the specific use of Scratch in
  workshop settings (Burke &amp; Kafai, 2010; Peppler &amp; Kafai, 2008).
  While both approaches offer important pieces of the larger whole, research
  with art as the primary focus is far less common, and often requires some
  reading between the lines.
</p>
<p>
  One way to proceed out of this gap is to step back and consider how the
  wider environment has led to this point. New media may be relatively new,
  but it still has its own history and developmental arc. The growth of
  creative coding has tracked closely to the rise of “making” or “maker
  culture” (Halverson &amp; Sheridan, 2014), which has been written about
  extensively both academically and in the popular press. Considering the
  culture surrounding these tools and this manner of making is one way to get
  closer to the related experience of creating art through code. In many
  places the maker movement and creative coding overlap, with the latter
  often utilized by the former, and both occupy similar spaces within the
  greater sphere of art and technology.
</p>
<p>
  Reflecting this, in this literature review I will begin from the point of
  what creative coding tools are and the impetus for their development.
  Following that, I will discuss the rise of the culture of “making” and how
  it has incorporated the tools of creative coding, and where the two
  overlap. I will then consider where they differ, with a focus on issues of
  inclusivity and diversity. Next I will review past research on creative
  coding in educational contexts. Lastly, I will look to where creative
  coding, maker culture, and the sharing of artwork intersect in online
  communities, and the kinds of research that have previously been
  undertaken.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Computer art to the birth of creative coding</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Art has been created with computers for nearly as long as computers have
  existed. Ben Laposky’s “Oscillons,” in which he used oscilloscopes to
  manipulate the flow of electrons to a small screen, date to the early
  1950’s, and are arguably some of the earliest computer art works ever
  created (“A History of Computer Art”, n.d.). Frieder Nake began creating
  his algorithmic plotter drawings in the 1960’s, generating striking homages
  to Paul Klee in the process (“A History of Computer Art”, n.d.). Both
  artists predated the introduction of the modern graphical user interface
  (GUI) by Xerox PARC in the 1970’s, and effectively had to generate their
  works with tools and implements of their own creation.
</p>
<p>
  For mathematicians and computer scientists, coding the environments and
  systems by hand to generate art might have been doable, but for the average
  individual it would be decades more before computer-based art making tools
  would start to become accessible. Familiar programs like Microsoft Paint
  would launch in 1985, Adobe Photoshop in 1990, and Macromedia Flash (later
  branded as Adobe Flash) in 1996. However, each of these and similar tools
  arguably supported existing artistic mediums such as photography and
  animation more than they served new ones. In the mainstream, the computer
  was still not necessarily a tool for new media, and coding was not a tool
  for art making.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Processing. </strong>
  In 2001 Ben Fry and Casey Reas began work on what would become Processing,
  marking the rough beginning of creative coding as anything approaching an
  accessible, widespread phenomenon. In part a spiritual successor to John
  Maeda’s Design by Numbers framework, Processing was initially conceived
  within MIT’s Media Lab Aesthetics and Computation Group (Maeda, 2009). Fry
  and Reas designed Processing to act as a first programming language
  (“Overview”, n.d.), but one that would drastically shorten the distance
  between code and visual feedback (Reas &amp; Fry, 2015). The idea being
  that a large part of what makes learning to code so difficult and so
  off-putting is how obscured the path is from what you have to learn to what
  you want to make. Reas &amp; Fry (2015) described this problem as having to
  eat your vegetables before you can have dessert (p. 1).
</p>
<p>
  Processing was not the first coding tool designed with creative visual
  expression in mind, but it came at the right time. The drive towards STEM
  education over the last decade has fueled the need for new ways for
  students to learn to code, that are more accessible to wider numbers of
  people. Processing is one of perhaps two main tools for doing so that have
  been adopted into educational settings, and is particularly prevalent at
  the high school and univers­ity level.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Scratch. </strong>
  For younger learners, it is MIT’s Scratch that has become the primary entry
  point into coding creatively. Scratch is a visual block-based programming
  language, where virtual blocks can be “snapped” together to create
  programmatic instructions (Dasgupta &amp; Resnick, 2014). Scratch
  development began in 2003, with the modern web-based version initially
  launching in 2007 (Resnick et al., 2009).
</p>
<p>
  Scratch was designed specifically to serve youth ages 10-18 from
  economically disadvantaged and culturally diverse communities (Maloney et
  al., 2004). This would be a pretty unique characteristic on its own, but
  its creators also sought to design something that could be used
  independently of the traditional classroom, and appeal to students’    <em>existing</em> interests (Maloney et al., 2004, p. 1). They wanted to
  “nurture a new generation of creative, systematic thinkers” (Resnick et
  al., 2009, p.60), and build a language that encouraged a diversity of
  different kinds of projects, intense personalization, and a social
  community.
</p>
<p>
  As far as the tools go, Processing and Scratch are quite different. While
  Processing adheres to the more traditional text-based system of input,
  Scratch works entirely through the metaphor of building with blocks.
  Scratch blocks come in a variety of shapes and colors, and critically are
  only allowed to be connected if they can properly function together.
  Maloney et al. (2004) justified the block-based approach primarily on this
  basis, as it eliminated the chance for syntax errors (essentially
  grammatical mistakes in code), which had long proven an obstacle for
  learning traditional textual programming languages. This would allow new
  learners to “focus on the problems they want to solve, not the mechanics of
  programming” (Maloney et al., 2004, p. 4).
</p>
<p>
  Today the Scratch website currently hosts almost 22 million projects,
  spanning all manner of interactive stories, art, games, and more, built by
  more than 18 million registered users (“Scratch Statistics”, n.d.).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Coinciding with the culture of making</strong>
</p>
<p>
  At the same time that creative coding tools were starting to hit anything
  approaching the mainstream, so too was the “maker movement” or culture of
  “making” gaining momentum. <em>Make</em> magazine, a “central organ” of the
  movement (“More than just digital quilting”, 2011), published its inaugural
  issue in 2005, and the first “Maker Faire” was held in the Bay Area in 2006
  (“Maker Faire: A Bit of History,” n.d.).
</p>
<p>
  Halverson &amp; Sheridan (2014) defined the maker movement as “people who
  are engaged in the creative production of artifacts in their daily lives
  and who find physical and digital forums to share their processes and
  products with others” (p.496). <em>Adweek</em> (Voight, 2014) described it
  as “a convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans.”    <em>The Economist</em> (“More than just digital quilting”, 2011) as “an
  outgrowth of digital culture, made possible by the convergence of several
  trends.”
</p>
<p>
  Taken together, the maker movement is most commonly characterized by a
  combination of technology, attitude, and community. “Making” comes in a
  particular context of tools and creative impulses. This is much the same as
  the driving ideas behind the creation of creative coding tools. Resnick et
  al. (2009) emphasize that by using Scratch, youth are learning mathematical
  and computational concepts, how to think and reason creatively, and how to
  collaborate with others (p. 60). John Maeda (2009), in discussing what
  brought on the creation of Processing, mentions how its designers wanted
  other programmers and artists to have “an easy way to share work with each
  other and understand each other’s ideas.” Those designers would themselves
  implore learners “in the spirt of community” (Reas &amp; Fry, 2015, p. 5)
  to share their projects and knowledge online, at Processing.org and other
  social media platforms.
</p>
<p>
  The three pillars of technology, attitude, and community are both common to
  creative coding and the maker movement, and their fundamental foundations.
  In the case of creative coding, the technology aspect is for all practical
  purposes inseparable from the greater concept. Code has meaning because of
  the technological systems supporting it, from silicon to software. For
  making, it is tools like 3D printing or microcontrollers in the form of
  Arduino or Raspberry PI that are, almost without exception, mentioned in
  any press coverage or study pertaining to the larger movement. In less
  common cases, coding, programming, or hacking are mentioned as being a part
  of the maker movement (Madda, 2016; Martinez &amp; Stager, 2013; Martin,
  2015), operating as the firmly digital end of the new media toolset.
</p>
<p>
  Coming to this point it might be tempting to think of creative coding as
  simply a subset of the larger maker movement, firmly enclosed within. This
  would be a mistake for many reasons, not the least of which are rooted in
  some of the criticism of the culture of making, and particularly its
  practical implementations.
</p>
<p>
  Arguably one of the great attractions of the maker movement is built on the
  premise of “if you build it they will come.” That simply through providing
  the technology, it is possible to reap the benefits of its use. But by
  treating the tools that are so characteristic of making as the driving
  power of the movement, the more compelling accompanying cultural shift is
  lost. Martin (2015) goes so far to describe this as a “fatally flawed
  conceptualization” that will “certainly fail” (p. 37). Justice (2015) ran
  into this same problem from another perspective, noting the perceived
  pressure instructors felt to adapt iPads into curricula already well served
  by pencil and paper (p. 121). Changing a lesson from paper to iPad does not
  fundamentally change the nature of the lesson, just the medium. It is based
  on the assumption that the new technology is somehow better than old, even
  when in service of the same problem.
</p>
<p>
  What makes creative coding relevant is what it can do to shift what we can
  create, and how we learn, with particular regards to art and code. Divorced
  from the culture and support surrounding them, the tools revert to only
  being useable by those who already possess the skills and educational
  capital to utilize them. As Robb &amp; Laruicella (2014) put it, “do not
  assume that simply giving a child a device will lead to learning” (p. 80).
  It is the attitude and culture surrounding creative coding that make it
  matter in a wider context, and support particularly creative forms of
  artistic expression.
</p>
<p>
  Further cause for not linking creative coding and the maker movement too
  closely can be found in their differing approaches to inclusivity. Anytime
  “culture” is used to describe a phenomenon it is important to consider the
  question of <em>just whose culture is it</em>? And in the case of the maker
  movement especially this has raised a troubling answer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Diversity and inclusivity</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Grenzfurthner &amp; Schneider (n.d.) refer to the “white male nerd
  dominance” of “hackerspaces”, one of many names for spaces catering to
  maker culture. Halverson &amp; Sheridan (2014) draw the connection back to
  the “tinkerer” and robotics cultures that came before (p. 497), themselves
  dominated by white male representation. Perhaps most damningly, at a
  presentation at Stanford’s FabLearn conference for digital fabrication in
  education in 2013, Elizabeth Buechley looked back on the past nine years of    <em>Make</em> magazine covers and found that 85% depicted men, 15% depicted
  women, and incredibly <em>zero percent</em> depicted any people of color,
  saying “holy fuck Make…are you serious?” (2013).
</p>
<p>
  Buechley (2013) made clear that she believes we are all makers, but posed
  the question of who are the makers when we talk about “making”? Chachra
  (2015) personally answered this in the negative, declaring that she is not
  a maker, precisely because of the male-dominated system of valuation
  surrounding what is “made.” Perhaps this is the danger in any branded
  movement, with the brand serving its consumer niche. And in the case of the
  maker movement, that is predominantly white men.
</p>
<p>
  Creative coding is not free from the concerns of representation either. The
  development of creative coding is in many ways a response to the lack of
  diversity within computer science and the technology sector at large. As
  the creators of Scratch have said “we wanted to develop an approach to
  programming that would appeal to people who hadn’t previously imagined
  themselves as programmers” (Resnick et al., 2009). Reas &amp; Fry (2015)
  describe Processing as a “positive departure” from the way that programming
  is usually taught, and that it is in large part aimed at art and design
  students first learning to code (p. XI).
</p>
<p>
  The underlying implication in both projects is that you open up programming
  to more people when you start supporting more diverse forms of creation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Past research on creative coding tool use</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Past research on creative coding tends to align with one of three
  perspectives: the efficacy of teaching computer science, expanding
  programming to more diverse audiences, or the possibilities of new kinds of
  digital projects. Each offers a piece of grander vision for creative
  coding, but the purposes and intentions behind the research are at times
  starkly different.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>As a means to teach computer science concepts. </strong>
  The most straightforward way to consider creative coding is simply to ask
  how effective it is at teaching programming. As a field, programming exists
  within the wider realm of computer science, in which there is a widespread
  understanding that introductory courses are generally seen as extremely
  difficult (Bennedsen &amp; Caspersen, 2007). Watson &amp; Li (2014) went so
  far as to describe the phrases “failure rate” and “programming course” as
  “almost synonymous” (p. 39). The challenge of teaching programming is often
  viewed as a twofold problem: one of both conveying difficult subject
  matter, and of retaining new learners past introductory courses. Under this
  lens, creative coding could offer a solution to both issues.
</p>
<p>
  Meysenburg (2011) describes one approach by a small liberal arts college to
  incorporate Processing into their introductory CS1 course. Focusing largely
  on engagement and retention, Meysenburg argued that traditional
  console-based approaches did not “’grab’ or excite today’s students” (p.
  3), and that by utilizing the media-output heavy Processing, they would be
  able to both retain more majors in the department and attract more students
  into it, while still teaching Java (and programming) fundamentals. While
  largely anecdotal, Meysenburg described the department as being “very
  satisfied” (p. 13) with the choice to use Processing.
</p>
<p>
  The approach and justification outlined by Meysenburg (2011) largely
  mirrors that of Malan &amp; Leitner’s (2007) proposed use of Scratch for
  introductory computer science courses at Harvard. Their goal was “not to
  improve scores but instead to improve first-time programmers’ experiences”
  (p. 223). Again, the “grabbing” power of creative coding was in full force,
  empowering students to create the kinds of work that would be meaningful to
  them, rather than having to focus on learning syntax.
</p>
<p>
  Other researchers have attempted to measure learning output through
  creative coding tools more quantitatively. Scaffidi and Chambers (2012)
  looked at the breadth and depth of more than 1000 online Scratch projects
  by 250 users by considering the types and amounts of different coding
  blocks in use. The idea being that the greater the number and variety of
  blocks used over time, the more concepts a user was learning and
  incorporating into their work. Ultimately they found that users of Scratch
  tended to use fewer blocks of decreasing diversity over time, but a later
  revisitation of the same study with a more complete dataset found precisely
  the opposite (Matias, Dasgupta, &amp; Hill, 2016). By looking at the full
  dataset of nearly 650,000 projects by 140,000 users, Matias, Dasgupta,
  &amp; Hill (2016) concluded that Scaffidi &amp; Chambers (2012) had likely
  simply drawn an “unlucky” (p. 4) sample, and that more time spent with
  Scratch leads to a greater depth and breadth of understanding. This is
  reassuring, if not intuitively unsurprising.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most important aspects of creative coding is the ability to
  easily share and engage with other users. Both Processing and Scratch
  strongly promote sharing as an integral part of the creative process, but
  Scratch goes a step farther by employing the concept of “remixing” for
  online projects. A Scratch “remix” is a modified and re-shared version of a
  project uploaded to the Scratch website, and constitutes approximately one
  third of all recently uploaded projects (“Remix”, n.d.). Research into
  remixing has found that users who do so more often have “larger repertoires
  of programming commands” (Dasgupta, Hale, Monroy-Hernández, &amp; Hill,
  2016, p. 1), and that exposure to new concepts through remixing increases
  the “likelihood of using those concepts” (p. 1).
</p>
<p>
  For computer science educators, creative coding allows for a decreased
  focus on the dull grind of learning syntax and command line interaction,
  and an increased ability for students to create the kinds of things they
  want to make (including games, animations, and other art). Creative coding
  is part of the solution to the issue of retention by making programming
  more appealing to new learners, both for those who intend to become
  computer science majors, and for those who otherwise might not.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    As a means to introduce programming to more diverse learners.
  </strong>
  If creative coding can make programming more engaging for people who have
  already been attracted to it, what can it do for those who haven’t? If
  tools like Processing and Scratch can “grab” and retain more learners who
  already felt welcomed enough to consider the field, then perhaps they can
  also act to expand it to learners who are excluded. In this mindset, the
  second perspective of past creative coding research takes aim at how to
  expand the field of programming to a more diverse audience, and include
  individuals that have not had the privilege of access to more traditional
  computer science education.
</p>
<p>
  The technology sector has a well-known and frankly shocking problem with
  diversity. In a comprehensive “tech diversity scorecard” published by    <em>The Verge</em> (Ricker, 2015), fully 71% of the employees at Google,
  Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Intel were identified as
  male, and 60% as white. In an article published by <em>Re/code</em>
  (Wagner, 2015), a former manager at Twitter who identifies as Black
  described a lack of “diversity in thought” and an even greater lack of
  diversity in “action.” It is worth stating the obvious here and saying    <em>this is bad</em>.
</p>
<p>
  The exclusion continues across into academia. In 2014 not a single Black
  high schooler took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science in    <em>eleven </em>US states, or a Hispanic high schooler in <em>eight</em>
  (Heitin, 2014). Of the nearly 5,000 test-takers in California, only 74
  identified as Black (Heitin, 2014). When Resnick et al. (2009) talk about
  the importance of making “the floor even lower and the walls even wider”
  for programming with Scratch (p. 63), this lack of diversity is the
  unspoken driver behind that impulse.
</p>
<p>
  “Widening the walls” as Resnick et al. (2009) described, is an idea
  repeated throughout creative coding literature. Malan &amp; Leitner (2007)
  proposed the use of Scratch for first-time programmers, in an effort not to
  improve scores but to improve “experiences” (p. 223). What they found was
  that students without prior background in programming had noticeably more
  positive views of Scratch than their peers, with the only neutral and
  negative comments coming from those who already had experience working with
  code (p. 227). In light of who the tech sector is excluding, a challenge to
  the established narrative of computer science learning in favor of those
  who are <em>new</em> as opposed to those who are experienced is a positive
  development for the greater goal of diversity.
</p>
<p>
  Maloney, Peppler, Kafai, Resnick, &amp; Rusk (2008) looked at implementing
  Scratch in after school programs, in an effort to reach learners not served
  by in-school resources. As they saw it, part of the challenge of expanding
  programming education was combatting the lack of “instructional
  interventions” and “experienced mentors” (p. 367) in schools attended by
  low-income students. What they found was that work created with Scratch
  better resonated with the interests of the students, and perhaps most
  surprisingly that the youth did not see what they were doing as
  “programming” (p. 370). Again, as with Malan &amp; Leitner (2007), what
  might sound negative at first implies a different and <em>better </em>kind
  of experience for new learners. Not identifying Scratch as computer
  programming means that for those youths the bias and exclusionary reality
  of the wider field were temporarily irrelevant while they worked on their
  projects, following their own interests.
</p>
<p>
  Peppler &amp; Kafai (2008) noted that low-income youth are “standing on the
  sidelines when it comes to developing new technologies” (p. 140), in their
  study on media-arts workshops in economically disadvantaged communities.
  That hardly goes far enough: the lack of disadvantaged individuals in
  programming, computer science, and the tech sector at large is a reflection
  of the active exclusionary practices that have kept them out. It is not
  just low-income populations that are excluded, and neither is it a new
  problem.
</p>
<p>
  Research on incorporating new populations into programming goes back to the
  early days of personal computing. Dohn &amp; Wagner (1987) investigated
  teaching computer science to university-level arts students, and found that
  the vast majority had great difficult learning the concepts. While not yet
  created at the time of the study, it begs the question of if their results
  would have been different had they had access to tools like Processing or
  Scratch, or if they might not have concluded that arts and science may need
  to be considered as “two different realms” (Dohn &amp; Wagner, 1987, p.
  234). Had they been able to start the course by teaching Processing or
  Scratch instead of PASCAL, would they instead have written about the power
  of integrative new media?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>As a means to new media.</strong>
  Underlying much of the literature is an understanding that creative coding
  can do more than just increase access to its parent fields. That more than
  simply support traditional modes of programming and art making, it can draw
  new lines between mediums in ways previous tools and techniques could not.
</p>
<p>
  Burke &amp; Kafai (2010) looked at creative coding as a way to teach
  students about narrative and storytelling while developing their writing
  abilities. Burke &amp; Kafai noted that past research on “digital
  storytelling” considered solely its effectiveness in introducing learners
  to programming, whereas they were much more interested in how programming
  could support storytelling and creative writing skills. What they found was
  that beyond offering a compelling incentive to push through the challenges
  of learning to code, the work of learning how to tell a story shifted with
  the use of Scratch to a more “immediate revisionary” process (p. 351).
  Rather than have to complete the arc of the story before they could
  consider its effectiveness, students tended to test individual scenes as
  they were developed, determining as they went what worked and what did not.
</p>
<p>
  Reworking the mentality of how to create appears again throughout the work
  on Scratch “remixes”, an aspect of the online tool that allows any Scratch
  user to easily copy, alter, and re-share the creations of others.
  Appropriating and engaging with content outside their own allows learners
  to be exposed to others with “different skills, knowledge, and experiences”
  (Dasgupta, Hale, Monroy-Hernández, &amp; Hill, 2016, p. 1), and ideally
  enable them to achieve more complex goals.
</p>
<p>
  This relationship between appropriation and collaboration is pushed even
  further in crowd-sourced art projects like those described by Dasgupta
  &amp; Resnick (2014), and Dasgupta (2013), where multiple users could draw
  onto the same canvas. Dasgupta (2013) points out that one of these types of
  projects was remixed by a 13-year-old participant in the study, improving
  on the underlying code of the project (p. 33). This means that not only was
  there collaboration on the content of the artwork, the very medium of code
  beneath it was <em>also</em> altered collaboratively.
</p>
<p>
  For creative coding, the creative process is not limited to only the
  immediate content generated: it is also about engaging and altering the
  medium beneath. This overlaps with the hierarchical conceptualization
  required across much of computer science, but also with art making in
  general, where medium and content are interconnected yet distinct concepts.
  In this light, one of the most striking findings of Maloney et al. (2008)
  should come as no surprise: “when asked whether Scratch reminded the youth
  of anything at school, all of the youth said Scratch was at least like one
  school subject, and most cited several subjects that they thought connected
  to their experiences in Scratch. The most frequent response was generally
  to the arts” (p. 370).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>A look at creative coding online communities</strong>
</p>
<p>
  At the intersection of creative coding, making, and the drive to expand
  digital literacy beyond the privilege of the classroom, is the monolith of
  internet community. Borne out of shared affinities rather than common
  location or age, internet communities surrounding creative coding provide
  the means to support, share, and collaborate with fellow learners. These
  kinds of interactions are integral to both the culture of making, focused
  as it is on sharing both mistakes and successes (Halverson &amp; Sheridan,
  2014), and the greater do-it-yourself (DIY) culture prevalent throughout
  the internet, with its need for documentation and repetition (Tseng &amp;
  Resnick, 2014). For creative coding, online communities represent both of
  these mentalities.
</p>
<p>
  Past research on creative coding online communities are nearly entirely
  limited to scratch.mit.edu, the online component of Scratch. Hosting nearly
  22 million projects by more than 18 million users, with more than 110
  million comments, and 180,000 forum discussions with nearly 2 million posts
  at the time of this writing (“Scratch Statistics,” n.d.; “Discuss Scratch,”
  n.d.), it is by far the largest and most active of the communities
  surrounding the primary creative coding tools. In contrast, the Processing
  and openFrameworks forums are each home to just shy of 20,000 discussions
  (“Recent Discussions,” n.d.; “About openFrameworks,” n.d.).
</p>
<p>
  Research considering the online Scratch community is framed largely from
  the same perspective that research on the tool itself is: how social
  behavior online ultimately affects the development of programming skills
  (Fields, Giang, &amp; Kafai, 2014; Scaffidi, Dahotre, &amp; Zhang, 2012).
  In that sense, the results are mixed, with Fields, Giang, &amp; Kafai
  (2014) finding that for the most part there was no connection between
  online participation and the use of more complex coding concepts. But the
  greater question of what role online communities have in the creative
  learning process is only becoming more relevant with time, as the reach of
  the social web continues to expand, bringing the opportunity for
  collaboration along with it.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, what collaboration means for learners new to creative coding is
  not yet entirely clear. In a study investigating discussion between novice
  animation programmers on the Scratch website, Scaffidi, Dahotre, &amp;
  Zhang (2012) noted that “we do not know which kinds of online forum posts
  are effective at initiating useful discussions, and we even lack
  information about what collaboration really <em>means </em>in this context”
  (p. 191). That lack of definition likely has many causes, but it is hardly
  a stretch to think that it is at least in part a reflection of the fluidity
  of the creative coding process, and the many routes to collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  In looking at the emergence of an online folk-art gaming community, Salter
  (2010) called the work of the authors “collaborative yet personal.” Salter
  observed that individuals would build upon the creations of other members
  of the community, a relationship between self and group directly
  reminiscent of Scratch remixing. Furthermore, that re-appropriation was not
  limited to just work within the community: it extended to the wider culture
  as well. Salter noted, “it is here—and in spaces like it, throughout the
  Internet, where older forms of popular culture are routinely processed,
  consumed, re­mandated, and taken as inspiration for new content that holds
  its audience through a shared heritage of stories built toward a world of
  new ideas.”
</p>
<p>
  What Salter identified may well be an inalienable quality of the internet,
  if not technology as well. Whether it’s research on documentation on the
  DIY website <em>Instructables</em> (Tseng &amp; Resnick, 2014), or on youth
  sharing the progression of their artwork over time through animation (Tseng
  &amp; Resnick, 2016), there is a powerful undercurrent of making    <em>process</em> available online in the hope of supporting this kind of
  creative making. As the children of these tendencies and technologies, the
  tools of creative coding and their online communities are meaningfully
  inseparable.
</p>

<h2 id="method">
  Method
</h2>

<p>
  The primary question I set out to investigate was, what can be learned
  about the kinds of artworks created through creative coding tools by
  studying their online communities? In analyzing a sample of work featured
  online by Scratch and Processing users, I sought to better understand what
  artistic tendencies and trends are being elevated to prominence within
  those communities.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Methodology</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To investigate the kinds of art being made through Processing and Scratch,
  I considered a sample of recent works posted to the Exhibition section of
  the Processing website, processing.org, and the Explore section of the
  Scratch website, scratch.mit.edu. Exhibition and Explore both consist of a
  curated selection of work produced through each respective tool, though
  they do so in different ways. What is presented on Explore is derived
  algorithmically from activity on the scratch.mit.edu platform, whereas
  Exhibition is more traditionally curated by individuals (“Exhibition,”
  n.d.), and links out to other locations on the web.
</p>
<p>
  Taking a grounded theory based approach, I sought patterns in the sampled
  online works through my observations, building up a view of artmaking
  through these creative coding tools (Merriam, 1998, p. 17). Those
  observations attempted to take into account the incredible breadth of
  creation possible through Processing and Scratch, where the idea of medium
  is increasingly fluid, and interactivity, movement, collaboration,
  appropriation, and engagement with the physical and digital worlds are all
  up for grabs.
</p>
<p>
  One of the primary challenges in this study was to be able to analyze a
  relatively appropriate amount of work in each community. Coding for themes
  qualitatively is time-consuming, and the numerical bounds of possible works
  to be considered was in the millions. By looking at a sample of works on
  the order of dozens that have been determined to be “popular” in each
  community, I attempted not to generate a perfectly representative sample so
  much as an aspirational one. In an environment where remixing the work of
  others has been shown to increase the use of concepts found in those
  sources (Dasgupta, Hale, Monroy-Hernández, &amp; Hill, 2016), what was
  “popular” seemed likely to be work that had benefited from this iterative
  process of adoption and alteration, or will become the basis for such
  behavior in the future.
</p>
<p>
  Observing what the community chose to elevate allowed for the chance to see
  what users found particularly engaging, and the kinds of work they may be
  working towards. Buried in the millions of publically shared Scratch and
  Processing projects are almost undoubtedly vast numbers of works that are
  effectively first efforts, where the creators are limited by technical
  ability more than conceptual creativity. By considering what was “popular”
  I aimed to avoid considering Scratch and Processing in terms of users’
  ability to learn programming, and instead in terms of their ability to
  generate creative art.
</p>
<p>
  This nonprobability sampling was based in solving the qualitative problem
  of what kinds of art the tools and community support, rather than in
  achieving a representative sample of what users are actually generating on
  a regular basis (Merriam, 1998, p. 61). It was also a criterion-based
  sampling where the works I considered must have been deemed “popular”
  either by being featured in the “Exhibition” or “Explore” sections of the
  processing.org and scratch.mit.edu websites, and listed as “art” on
  scratch.mit.edu.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Design of the study</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Site. </strong>
  The sites of the study are the Processing and Scratch websites,
  processing.org and scratch.mit.edu. The websites operate fairly
  differently, with scratch.mit.edu serving as the primary workspace for
  Scratch users, and processing.org existing largely as a repository of
  knowledge about the tool and the works generated with it. Both are the
  primary websites for their respective tool, and the most prominent sources
  of information for both.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of scratch.mit.edu, the website <em>is</em> Scratch: the most
  recent version of the tool is entirely web-based and hosted on
  scratch.mit.edu, alongside the Scratch forums. In the case of Processing,
  things are much more fragmented: processing.org is the home of the
  organization that develops and promotes Processing, but the tool is not
  web-based<sup>[1]</sup>, and does not share as easily as Scratch. Likely
  for that reason, finding works created through Processing is a more varied
  process, spread across a variety of social media platforms and enthusiast
  websites, and isn’t always representative of the true nature of the work.
  Interactive code might be flattened to a single image or video, diluting
  any intended multi-sensory experience
</p>
<p>
  Considering these challenges, I chose to solely consider work found through
  processing.org, trusting that the Processing Foundation would tend to share
  pieces that are effectively documented, as well as being representative of
  the tool and the creativity of its users.
</p>
<p>
  Documentation in this case is key, as it is through combinations of text,
  images, audio, video, and other modes of expression that I hoped to achieve
  an accurate view of these artworks, whose intended presentation experiences
  might not be technically or physically available.
</p>
<p>
  For scratch.mit.edu, I sampled works from the Explore section, filtered by
  “art” and what was “popular”. This limited the selection to what users have
  uploaded and tagged as “art”, and what the community and scratch.mit.edu
  algorithms had deemed “popular.” For processing.org, I sampled the most
  recent works in the Exhibition section, a “curated collection of projects
  created with Processing” with “new software added each month”
  (“Exhibition”, 2016).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Participants. </strong>
  Participants for this study were the users of scratch.mit.edu, and the
  individuals whose work has been shared on processing.org. The total number
  of participants represented in the study was 100, and while no information
  is readily available on Processing users, there are some basic statistics
  available for scratch.mit.edu users. There was no readily available way to
  determine if the users creating “popular” works on scratch.mit.edu differed
  noticeably from the community as a whole, but generally speaking
  scratch.mit.edu users cluster between the ages of 10 and 16, with the most
  common age being 12 (“Scratch Statistics,” n.d.), and are 67% male
  according to self-reported figures (Fields, Giang, &amp; Kafai, 2014).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Researcher’s role.</strong>
  <em> </em>
  My role was as a non-participant, observing works at a remove online,
  drawing conclusions from those observations.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Data collection. </strong>
  I observed artwork on scratch.mit.edu and processing.org. These works are
  in one sense documents, but due to the nature of their necessary supporting
  environments do not always translate well into more traditional images,
  videos, or clips of sound. For this reason, they might better be thought of
  as performances; performances that I observed, taking written notes and
  recording images as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  The specific artworks I considered are those featured at the time of
  collection in the Exhibition section of processing.org, and on the Explore
  section of scratch.mit.edu. I observed 50 works on each site, in an attempt
  to reasonably respect the variety of art I expected to encounter.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Limits of the study. </strong>
  A study of a handful of artworks has very little chance of being
  representative of the millions being created through dozens of prominent
  creative coding tools. Further limiting the sample selection to what was
  “popular”, and in the case of scratch.mit.edu listed as “art”, compounds
  the reality that this study does not represent all experiences with these
  tools. The purpose of this study is to better understand what manner of
  artistic creations users of Processing and Scratch may be working towards,
  not what the tools themselves are capable of.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Data analysis.</strong>
  <em> </em>
  Analyzing the study data presented an interesting challenge. Most of the
  work I observed I expected to not be bounded in the same way as traditional
  visual, auditory, or performance media. I utilized research codes to
  identify patterns and themes, though doing so was difficult when the range
  of both could be so broad. Miles &amp; Huberman (1994) recommend a “start
  list” (p. 58) of research codes prior to any analysis, something that
  seemed particularly helpful here, as the analysis and the collection stages
  of the study began to muddy.
</p>
<p>
  By building a strong list of research codes to begin with, I hoped to have
  a framework on which I could start to read the incredible variety of
  artworks I expected to encounter. That framework however, changed over the
  course of the research coding. Altheide (as cited in Merriam, 1998) said of
  categories and variables that guide a study, “others are allowed and
  expected to emerge throughout”, a phenomenon especially appropriate in the
  varied case of creative coding.
</p>
<p>
  Through research coding for patterns and themes, altering and changing them
  both as the data was collected and following, I attempted to build a view
  of what was consistent and inconsistent between these artworks. Research
  codes started more descriptive, before shifting to become more
  interpretive, and illustrative of higher patterns, as recommended by Miles
  &amp; Huberman (1994).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Positionality</strong>
</p>
<p>
  As someone with a background both in computer science and art, I believe
  that both fields benefit from the increasing overlap afforded by new media
  technologies. In this sense I am biased to believe that creative coding may
  have unique value in its ability to build links between artists and
  computer scientists.
</p>
<p>
  In designing a study I wanted to remove my presence as much as reasonably
  possible, and for that reason avoided a format where I would interview or
  otherwise directly interact with any participants. This felt especially
  appropriate given the digital nature of the study subject, and the
  asymmetrical form that sharing on the internet often takes, from one to
  many.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ethical considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The participants in this study have already shared their work online in
  publically accessible ways, with no reasonable expectation of privacy.
  Sharing is a core tenant of creative coding platforms (Maeda, 2009), and
  this study requires nothing more invasive than the observation of public
  work by public artists.

<h2 id="findings">
  Findings
</h2>

<p>
  In total, I considered 100 artworks on the Processing and Scratch websites,
  50 on each platform. I began with a rough list of research codes before
  settling into a final list of 17, grouped by five main themes. Those 17
  research codes were borne both out of my initial understanding of common
  trends in creative coding, which in part comes from my own artmaking
  practice, and through careful consideration of my first observations of the
  artworks. Research codes helped me to illuminate the wider themes in play,
  while the themes helped me to determine specific phenomena I could isolate
  through additional research codes.
</p>
<p>
  I will present the findings by the themes listed in Table 1: generation,
  appropriation, behavior, IRL (a common acronym for the phrase “in real
  life”), and purpose. I will do so both in terms of the totality of the
  works and broken out by platform. Each section will begin with a
  description of the research codes for that theme, followed by a summary of
  the primary results with descriptions of artworks exemplifying the more
  complex research codes as needed. I will generally consider the expression
  of research codes in terms of the percentage of the total per platform,
  with the aim of building a view of wider trends.

    Themes and research codes.

</div>

<p>
  <strong>Generation</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The theme of generation consists of three research codes for what kinds of
  output the piece generated (excluding any purely appropriated, unaltered
  media): <em>visual</em>, <em>auditory</em>, and <em>movement</em>.<em>Visual</em> consists of any work that has a visible component or focus.    <em>Auditory</em> refers to both any generated sounds or music, but not
  when it is simply the playback of someone else’s work without change (as is
  the case with many of the Scratch works). <em>Movement</em> is slightly
  more nuanced, referring to any piece that has a visual component that
  includes significant movement independent of any user interaction,
  including pre-written animations or any generative components.
</p>
<p>
  As shown in Table 2, nearly every artwork reviewed across both platforms
  had an important visual focus. The single exception, the Processing work    <em>Automatic Orchestra</em>, was an entirely auditory experience. The 99
  other works all utilized some form of visual expression, whether static or
  dynamic, or digital or physical.

    Generation. The theme of generation consists of three research codes:    <em>visual</em>, <em>auditory</em>, and <em>movement</em>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Twelve other Processing pieces and a lone Scratch piece joined    <em>Automatic Orchestra</em> in containing essential auditory experiences,
  separate from any appropriated audio. The majority of these pieces either
  utilized some form of generative sound creation, or recordings of noises or
  voices created for specifically them. In total, twenty-six percent of the
  Processing works and two percent of the Scratch works contained auditory
  elements.
</p>
<p>
  Movement was incorporated into fifty-eight percent of both the Processing
  and Scratch artworks, effectively mirroring the near match for those
  expressing essential visual elements. The Scratch work    <em>Journey's End (AMV | Art)</em> (Figure 1) provides an effective
  example, utilizing relatively simple animations that lead to a strong
  visual and emotional impact. The pieces that did not include movement
  tended to be either static images or physical objects.

<p>
  <strong>Appropriation</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The theme of appropriation consists of four research codes, <em>image</em>,    <em>audio</em>, <em>video</em>, and <em>remix</em>, to distinguish what
  kinds of works by other artists were incorporated into the piece.    <em>Image</em> consists of both directly imported photos or illustrations,
  or their close and accurate reproduction. <em>Audio</em> includes any
  appropriated sounds or music, and <em>video</em> any appropriated video
  clips or their effective if not literal equivalent, like extended animated
  GIFs. The final research code, <em>remix</em>, includes any piece that
  significantly borrows or builds on the work of another, and utilizes it as
  its primary focus.
</p>
<p>
  As Table 3 shows, similar percentages of both the Processing and Scratch
  artworks included appropriated imagery (26% and 23%), video elements (8%
  and 2%), or in some way remixed past media (20% and 14%).

    Appropriation. The theme of appropriation consists of four research codes:<em>image</em>, <em>audio</em>, <em>video</em>, and <em>remix</em>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The majority of the Scratch remixes are simply utilizing the built-in remix
  function of the platform, making it very straightforward to categorize them
  as such. <em>Mountains (art)</em> (Figure 2) is one Scratch work that does
  not, but in its description the creator notes that they based the piece off
  of an image they found on Google. In a sense, <em>Mountains (art)</em> is a
  remix of that image, altering and enhancing aspects of the original.

<p>
  Processing works like <em>Strata </em>(Figure 3) and    <em>Digital Natives</em> perform a similar act of remixing, taking
  classical paintings and household objects respectively and refashioning
  them into something new. The Processing remixes tend to be built upon works
  outside of the spectrum of creative coding, whereas the Scratch remixes are
  usually branches off of previous Scratch projects.

<p>
  Compared to the other appropriation research codes, Processing and Scratch
  works diverged most heavily in their appropriation of audio. Fully 60% of
  the Scratch works reviewed included some form of this appropriation, and
  the overwhelming majority of those were utilizing songs as the background
  music to an animation. In some cases the music was synced or intimately
  paired to the visuals (<em>Ready Aim Fire Collab (Storyboard)</em>,<em>Swan Lake Art</em>), and in others this was not clearly the case (    <em>art curve2</em>, <em>Pixel Art Gallery</em>). In comparison only 16% of
  the reviewed Processing artworks included any appropriated audio elements.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Behavior</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The theme of behavior consists of five research codes, <em>interactive</em>
  , <em>elements of chance</em>, <em>performative</em>,    <em>change over time</em>, and <em>adaptive</em>, that describe how the
  piece acts and its relationship to the viewer. <em>Interactive</em>
  consists of any work that asks for meaningful contribution by the viewer to
  fulfill the experience. <em>Elements of chance</em> includes any piece that
  relies on an aspect of randomness, separate from intentional random action
  by the viewer. <em>Performative</em> includes any piece that is
  fundamentally meant to be experienced as a sequence, over a unit of time.
</p>
<p>
  The two research codes <em>change over time</em> and <em>adaptive</em>, are
  slightly more nuanced. <em>Change over time</em> refers to a piece that
  becomes in some way new after a period of time. This is different than
  something like a video that looks different at the 10 minute mark than the
  5 minute mark: the piece itself must change, as opposed to simply
  presenting aspects that were entirely predetermined. <em>Adaptive</em> is
  one step further into the esoteric, referring only to a piece that
  permanently alters itself in response to an outside stimulus.
</p>
<p>
  As shown in Table 4, the numbers of Processing and Scratch works with
  interactive elements were quite close, with 48% percent of former and 40%
  of the latter exhibiting some form of viewer interaction. Similarly, the
  numbers of works that could be considered performative were also fairly
  close, at 50% and 38% for Processing and Scratch pieces respectively.

    <em>Table 4. </em>
    Behavior. The theme of behavior consists of five research codes:<em>interactive</em>, <em>elements of chance</em>, <em>performative</em>,    <em>change over time</em>, and <em>adaptive</em>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Where behavior diverged was in the incorporation of elements of chance (40%
  versus 16%), change over time (40% versus 4%), and arguably adaption (10%
  versus 0%). Processing artworks were far more likely to include aspects of
  randomization than those created with Scratch, and similarly much more
  likely to change over time. In part, this may be a reflection of the nature
  of those research codes, as enduring “change” is supported by incorporating
  elements of randomness that ensure differing results over time.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Non-Linear Code</em>
  (Figure 4) is an example of a Processing work that links these concepts of
  chance and change over time. Taking inspiration from nature,    <em>Non-Linear Code</em> is comprised of programs that iterate over time,
  many of which “could be seen as sets of wave generators interacting with
  one another” (“Exhibition,” n.d.). As the waves interact, the visuals
  change, with no clear point to end on. The elements of chance exist in the
  unpredictable crashing of the waves together, even if perhaps from the
  perspective of the mathematics underpinning the piece there may be no
  ambiguity in the calculations.

<p>
  None of the Scratch works reviewed incorporated adaptive behavior, compared
  to 10% of those created with Processing. Considering the fine lines between
  adaption, interaction, and change over time, the fact that only five total
  works met the conditions of this research code is not hugely surprising.    <em>Traces, Physical Programming of Freeform Folding in Soft Matter </em>
  (Figure 5), exemplifies this specificity, as its core behavior could nearly
  as easily be considered in a number of other contexts.    <em>Traces, Physical Programming of Freeform Folding in Soft Matter</em>
  utilizes Processing to print patterns on polystyrene sheets that deform in
  response to light. It would not be all that different to think of this
  behavior in terms of performance, or interactivity, instead of as an
  adaption to the piece’s environment.

  <strong>IRL</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The theme of IRL, a common acronym for the phrase “in real life,” consists
  of two research codes, <em>physical component</em>, and    <em>real life analogue</em>, to describe a piece’s relationship to the
  non-digital world. <em>Physical component</em> refers to any work that has
  some component in real space outside of any representation within the
  computer. This includes such material creations as sculptures, prints,
  robotics, hardware, and anything else with a distinctly non-digital
  presence. The second theme of <em>real life analogue</em> is closely
  related to the first, but includes any work that seeks to represent
  something with an equivalent outside of digital space.
</p>
<p>
  As shown in Table 5, Processing and Scratch works differed heavily in their
  expression of the IRL elements. Zero of the Scratch artworks utilized any
  sort of physical component compared to 32 (64%) of the Processing ones.
  Only slightly less stark by comparison, 68% of the Processing pieces had
  corresponding real life analogues, compared to 20% of Scratch pieces.

    <em>Table 5. </em>
    IRL. The theme of IRL, which is a common acronym for "in real life,"
    consists of two research codes: <em>physical component</em>, and    <em>real life analogue</em>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  In the case of physical components, the gulf almost assuredly reflects the
  nature of the platforms. Scratch is a fundamentally web-based tool, with
  web-based creation and built-in web-based sharing and exhibition, so it
  should come as little surprise to see that all the works considered are
  those that stay bounded within that medium. Processing, at the time of this
  writing, lacks any dedicated online editor and so requires some level of
  technical translation to even be visible in that space.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of real life analogues, both Processing and Scratch works drew
  from human and natural sources alike. The Scratch work    <em>Pixel Art Seasons</em> (Figure 6) recreates the four seasons (and a few
  more hidden ones) in a digital space, whereas <em>Swan Lake Art</em> finds
  its inspiration in the Tchaikovsky ballet.

<p>
  <strong>Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The final theme is centered around the idea of purpose, and includes three
  research codes: <em>social message</em>, <em>utilizes data</em>, and    <em>solves a problem</em>. The first, <em>social message</em>, reflects any
  wider call to action or social commentary present in the artwork, or
  underlying it. <em>Utilizes data</em> includes any piece that relies on
  information that could reasonably be considered a dataset, either for
  interpretive or artistic purposes. The final theme,    <em>solves a problem</em>, consists of any work that explicitly sets out to
  generate a solution or answer to a specific challenge.
</p>
<p>
  As shown in Table 6, there is a clear contrast between Processing and
  Scratch works in terms of purpose. Only a single Scratch work (2%)
  incorporated a clear social message, compared to 12 of those created with
  Processing (24%).

  Processing works like <em>In the Air</em>,    <em>COP15 Generative Identity</em>, and <em>Avena+ Test Bed</em> (Figure 7)
  are all statements or explorations around humanity’s relationship to the
  environment, and the environmental effects of human activity. Other pieces
  like <em>Just Landed</em> explore the spread of epidemics, <em>Cascade</em>
  : news consumption and conversation, <em>My Little Piece of Privacy</em>:    <em> </em>personal privacy in a populated city. Intriguingly, the lone
  Scratch work carrying a clear social message, simply titled <em>Art</em>,
  is a presentation about the importance of art and perseverance in the face
  of adversity.

  Twenty percent of the Processing works attempted to solve a problem,

  ways, and <em>Terrapattern</em> to simplify the process of scanning large
  geographical regions. The three Scratch works in contrast all fulfilled the
  role of tutorial, with <em>Pixel Art Tutorial #1</em> and<em>Vector Art Tutorial</em> attempting to demonstrate their namesakes, and    <em>Winter Nail Art Tutorial! (VOICE)</em> how to paint your nails in
  various winter themes (with voiceover).

  <strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Artworks created with Processing and Scratch share many of the same
  characteristics, while also diverging heavily in certain specific areas. In
  terms of the generation of images and movement, appropriation of images and
  video elements, remixing, interactivity, and performative qualities, the
  Processing and Scratch works were very similar. However in terms of the
  generation and appropriation of audio, utilizing elements of chance, change
  over time, adaptive behavior, physical components, real life analogues,
  social messages, utilizing data, and solving problems, the Processing and
  Scratch works were quite different.

<h2 id="discussion">
  Discussion
</h2>

<p>
  Observing these shared Processing and Scratch artworks brought to light
  many intriguing points of differentiation, while also raising a number of
  tough questions. To tease apart the experiences and issues reflected in the
  artworks, I will discuss the trends and questions within sections roughly
  corresponding to the study themes of generation, appropriation, behavior,
  IRL (a common acronym for the phrase “in real life”), and purpose. Through
  careful consideration of these themes and the wider questions the study
  results raise, a fuller picture of the experiences around artmaking through
  creative coding can begin to emerge.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Generation and appropriation</strong>
</p>
<p>
  By and large the Processing and Scratch artworks were quite similar in
  their generation of visuals and movement, and their appropriation of
  imagery and videos. This was not all that surprising to discover given the
  primarily visual nature of the web, and the focus by both tools on visual
  making over other forms<sup>[2]</sup>. Where they strongly differed was in
  their generation and appropriation of audio.
</p>
<p>
  Twenty six percent of Processing pieces utilized generated audio compared
  to only 2% of Scratch pieces, and only 16% of the former included
  appropriated audio or music compared to 60% of the latter. That fewer
  Scratch pieces generated their own auditory components may be explained in
  part by the simple fact that so many were appropriating it from elsewhere.
  It is also important to point out that the appropriated audio for both
  Processing and Scratch pieces almost exclusively took the form of music,
  popular, niche, or otherwise, as opposed to sound effects or other noises.
</p>
<p>
  This difference in the use of audio, and by extension this difference in
  the use of <em>music</em>, is reflected in Meysenburg’s (2011) attempt at
  designing a more inclusive introductory computer science course at Doane
  College. Noting that their computer science and information science majors
  “are also involved in humanities pursuits, such as art, <em>music</em>
  [emphasis added], or theater,” (p. 1) and that “not all” (p. 2) students
  taking introductory courses will become majors in those fields, Meysenburg
  identified the reality that we are rarely interested in just one subject,
  and sought to respond to that truth.
</p>
<p>
  That the majority of the observed Scratch artworks incorporated music, and
  at such a higher rate than the works created by Processing artists, stands
  out in this light. While the difference between the tools may be explained
  by any number of factors, it is worth remembering that evidence in favor of
  an inclusion of wider interests is of critical importance to computer
  science and technology education. Scratch works incorporating music at a
  higher rate may be an indication the tool is better resonating with the
  interests of new learners, as Maloney, Peppler, Kafai, Resnick, &amp; Rusk
  (2008) discovered.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The complications of remixing</strong>
</p>
<p>
  While the Processing and Scratch artworks observed were fairly similar in
  terms of their use of remixing (20% compared to 14%), the numbers do not
  tell the whole story. One complication is that while remixing is an
  explicit feature of the Scratch platform, the more general concept can get
  murky quickly on closer investigation.
</p>
<p>
  The Scratch wiki defines a remix as a “modified and shared version” of a
  project (“Remix”, n.d.). This meshes with the greater focus on sharing as a
  means for understanding within the culture of making, which is itself “an
  outgrowth of digital culture” (“More than just digital quilting”, 2011). At
  a high level, it is reasonable to define the concept of remixing as an
  interrelated network of sharing, modification, understanding, and
  foundation building for future creation. The rub is in the details.
</p>
<p>
  All technology projects borrow code. Computing is built on a hierarchy of
  hardware and software, and the algorithms underpinning the latter define
  the work that it is possible to perform. When we create digitally, we are
  always leaning on that hierarchy of function beneath us. Truthfully,
  because of this, the concept of a remix is always going to be a little
  blurry at the edges, but this issue becomes especially acute in the case of
  some of the research codes for this study, and what can be defined as a
  remix.
</p>
<p>
  One example of this challenge is that code is often modeled from natural
  phenomena. Whether it is something like ant colony optimization algorithms,
  or a set of equations that model waves in an effort to recreate them, code
  can have a direct relationship with the outside world. In the case of a
  Processing piece like <em>Fluid Leaves</em>, where code is utilized to
  represent the movement of floating tea leaves, what exactly is being
  remixed, if anything? Is it the code that describes the fluid’s motion,
  likely borrowed from someone else? Or is it the water and the tea leaves
  themselves: a remix of a real life phenomenon? There are a whole host of
  implications that spread from this question, and the more general issue of
  what sharing and collaboration mean in a space between physical and digital
  contexts.
</p>
<p>
  In a concrete sense, determining what constitutes a remix matters simply
  because I had to decide for each artwork in the study if they were in fact
  a remix. Additionally, while Scratch has an explicit labeling system for
  works that are remixed, it only corresponds to those works which utilized
  the platform’s direct feature for doing so, and misses out on any more
  nuanced or expanded interpretation of the concept. <em>Large Napkin</em>, a
  Processing work, is a remix in my categorization because it appropriates
  the classic pattern from a Jacquard Loom to say and share something new.    <em>Digital Natives and Glitched Realities</em>, another Processing work,
  is a remix because it takes recognizable objects and reforms them into
  something new and novel. <em>Mountains (art)</em> (Figure 2), a Scratch
  work, is a remix not because it utilizes the built-in function but because
  it is an inspired recreation of an image that the artist found on Google.
</p>
<p>
  What all three of those cases have in common is that something clearly
  resonated with the artists about both what they appropriated, and how they
  changed what they took. The parallels to art and artmaking could hardly be
  clearer, recalling the finding by Maloney et al. (2008) that the most
  frequently identified school subject that youth said reminded them of
  Scratch was art.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Remixes, popularity, and “art”</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Interestingly, the 14% figure for the observed Scratch projects is
  noticeably lower than the percentage of remixes on scratch.mit.edu as
  whole, where approximately one third of all recently uploaded projects on
  the website are remixes (“Remix”, n.d.). Additionally, the website displays
  how many remixes have been created from a given piece, and every one of the
  observed artworks was remixed at least once, with an average of just over
  60 times, and a median of approximately 25.
</p>
<p>
  One possible explanation for both the discrepancy between being a remix and
  being remixed, and the high number of remixes for most of the Scratch
  works, could be the choice to narrow the study selection to only pieces
  tagged as “art” that were elevated to the top of the “popular” section of
  Explore. It may be that “art” projects on Scratch are remixed under a more
  convoluted set of circumstances, or simply that the “popular” ranking
  carries a preference for unique works rather than derivative ones. To my
  mind, the latter is more compelling, as it makes intuitive sense that a
  ranking system for what is popular would favor works that have more unique
  and inventive qualities, as evidenced through user engagement…like remixes.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth pointing out here that what is tagged as “art” on
  scratch.mit.edu does not necessarily include all of what many, including
  myself, might consider art. For some perspective, the complete list of top
  level categories on scratch.mit.edu are “All”, “Animations”, “Art”,
  “Games”, “Music”, “Stories”, and “Tutorials.” Truthfully many if not all of
  those categories are reasonably able to contain art, and the creators of
  pieces with those tags might think of their works as art <em>­as well</em>
  as being an animation, game, song, story, or tutorial. The challenge for
  this study was to be sure I was observing what creators intended as art,
  and considering works outside of the “Art” section risked that certainty
  even if in practice much of what is there may be intended as art as well.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Limited commonalities, and increasing differences</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Outside of the concerns of generation and appropriation, the observed
  Processing and Scratch artworks had very little in common. While roughly
  half of the works from each platform utilized interactivity and were
  performative in nature, there was almost no agreement in terms of the rest
  of the behavior, IRL, or purpose research codes.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of the theme of behavior, Processing artworks exhibited far
  greater incorporation of elements of chance, change over time, and
  adaptation. The reasons for this could range from greater support in
  Processing for different kinds of random and pseudo-random behavior    <sup>[3]</sup>, to differing goals for artists on each platform, to
  variations in technical ability. While the <em>why</em> is not obvious, it
  may also be that this is an expression of something as core as the general
  difference in ages of users of both platforms. While there are no available
  statistics on the average age of Processing users, by all appearances the
  audience skews older than Scratch’s. As shown in Figure 9, the distribution
  of the ages of new Scratch registrants is heavily clustered around 10-16,
  with 12 being the most common age (“Scratch Statistics”, n.d.).
</p>

<figure>

   <em>Figure 9. </em>
   Distribution of ages of new registrants to the Scratch website. Accurate as
   of March 2017 (https://scratch.mit.edu/statistics/).
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Compounding this difference is that elements of chance, change over time,
  and adaptation are all logically related concepts. A project that
  incorporates randomness might be noticeably different at any given point in
  time, drawing a link between the two research codes. Similarly, a piece
  that adapts to its environment could also be reasonably expected to change
  over time <em>as</em> it adapts.
</p>
<p>
  With all three research codes potentially linked in this way, the fact that
  they are all expressed at lower rates in the Scratch artworks than the
  Processing ones may say something more general than a simple lack of each
  particular quality. Artworks elevated by the Processing community may
  exhibit a deeper volatility, and aversion to the static, than the elevated
  Scratch artworks that in contrast appear to trend towards a greater level
  of appropriation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Real life and a sense of place</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The largest difference displayed by any of the research codes between the
  Processing and Scratch artworks was in the use of physical components, at
  64% to 0% respectively. Coming in close behind was the second IRL research
  code of real life analogues, at 68% for the Processing works and 20% for
  the Scratch ones. These gaps are almost assuredly due to the nature of the
  tools, and by extension how artists utilize them.
</p>
<p>
  Scratch was designed to function in economically disadvantaged spaces with
  fewer technological and instructional resources (Maloney et al., 2004), and
  consequently has transitioned into an entirely web-based tool. This has had
  the benefit of lowering the technical bar of entry even further, but it
  also means that it is fully <em>contained</em> within that space. That
  Scratch artists would stray less from their digital ecosystem than their
  Processing counterparts makes sense in this context, where creating art on
  the web in turn means creating art <em>for</em> the web.
</p>
<p>
  Processing artworks do not exist solely in one technological space: code
  must be written in an editor and translated into images, audio, video,
  physical objects, or embedded online to be shared publically. Working with
  Processing requires a greater consideration of the relationships between
  medium and technology than does the more self-contained Scratch. Combined
  with the apparent age gap between the two platforms, it becomes
  understandable that Processing artists would tend to engage more fully with
  the non-digital realm, given a potentially higher level of technical
  competence (due to both age <em>and</em> the higher bar to entry) and a
  necessary view of the tool as one that does not live solely on the
  internet.
</p>
<p>
  What all of the Processing works incorporating physical components have in
  common is that the utilization of Processing represents only a part of the
  greater whole. While this is in one sense obvious given that Processing is
  a <em>digital</em> tool, it is true in a greater sense than simply the
  distinction with the physical. <em>Avena+ Test Bed</em> uses Processing to
  create generative visual designs, but the final piece is represented in a
  real farm, planted with seeds and worked with tractors, farming equipment,
  and people. <em>Digital Rube Goldberg Processor</em> relies on Processing
  for certain elements of digital interpretation and translation, but in
  totality the piece incorporates cameras, microphones, a printer, Flickr,
  physical coordination, and a whole host of elements beyond software.    <em>Continuum </em>lets a user draw clothing designs in an application
  built with Processing, but the patterns must be printed and the clothes
  sewn and ultimately worn. None of these pieces or any of the others
  utilizing physical components would be accurately represented solely by
  their use of Processing. On the contrary, they would be almost
  unrecognizable.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The issues of purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The observed Scratch works were far less likely to include a social
  message, utilize data, or solve a specific problem than their Processing
  counterparts. While I expected to see some difference between the two
  platforms, the almost complete lack of representation here by the Scratch
  artworks was surprising: only three pieces solved some sort of problem, one
  piece expressed a clear social message, and zero utilized data.
</p>
<p>
  The reason for these gaps may again be rooted partially in the expected
  differences in age between the two groups of users, but it might also be a
  reflection of the more digitally-centric nature of Scratch works suggested
  by the results from the two IRL research codes discussed previously. The
  majority of the social messages on display within the observed Processing
  works dealt with issues that stretched beyond the digital space and into
  the real world, whether it was <em>Petting Zoo</em> asking the viewer to
  consider their relationship to the artificial elements in their
  environment, or <em>Avena+ Test Bed</em> exploring generative design as a
  means to enhance ecological diversity in farmland, or <em>Silenc </em>
  highlighting the difficulties of learning pronunciation in Western
  languages. If Scratch works are less likely to correspond to real life
  phenomena and incorporate physical elements, then perhaps they are also
  less likely to express messages that relate to the wider societal sphere.
</p>
<p>
  The single Scratch piece that employed a clear social message was simply
  titled <em>Art </em>(Figure 10). A brief presentation controlled by the use
  of the arrow keys, <em>Art</em> tells the viewer through a series of
  character drawings and accompanying messages that art is there for you,
  that it does not have to please anyone else, that you can persevere through
  adversity, and that you should ultimately follow your dreams.

   adversity and follow their dreams
   (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/52989796/).

</figure>

<p>
  While just one piece out of 50, it is fascinating that the sole example of
  a social message from the Scratch works is so meta in its message, and so
  directed at the individual viewer.
</p>
<p>
  The closest equivalent in the Processing artworks might be    <em>My Little Piece of Privacy</em> (Figure 11), which also implicates the
  directly-observing individual in its message, though in such a way as to
  still illuminate the wider issue of privacy. <em>Art</em> does not
  encompass this sort of expansion, and instead takes aim at the personal
  insecurities of the viewer. Once again, the Processing example maintains an
  outward focus, even as it points the figure at a single individual, while
  the Scratch work carries a universal message grounded firmly in the
  personal.

<p>
  In terms of utilizing data the explanation for the difference between
  Processing and Scratch may be quite straightforward, with the younger
  Scratch audience not yet as exposed to the mathematics and statistical
  reasoning necessary to reckon with large sets of data. Or perhaps it is a
  further effect of considering solely works tagged as “art” on the Scratch
  website, which may be less likely to incorporate traditional datasets that
  other categories. Or once again it could be a reflection of the outward
  focus of many of the Processing artworks in contrast to the more inward
  facing Scratch ones, with Processing artists pulled towards engaging with
  data though the kinds of social issues they have chosen to speak to.
  Unfortunately, within the bounds of this study there is no real way to
  determine which answer might be the correct one, or if it is some
  combination of all of them, as intuition suggests may well be the case.
</p>
<p>
  For the final Purpose research code, <em>solves a problem</em>, a clear
  trend emerged. While the 10 Processing works offered solutions for problems
  in a number of different ways, the 3 Scratch pieces all took the form of
  tutorials: <em>Pixel Art Tutorial #1</em> demonstrated how to get started
  drawing pixel art, <em>Vector Art Tutorial</em> how to draw vector art, and    <em>Winter Nail Art Tutorial! (VOICE)</em> how to paint your nails with
  winter-inspired imagery. Consistent with the tendencies discussed
  previously, the Scratch works focus directly on the viewer as their
  subject, teaching the viewer to solve a problem that they possess.
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, many (though not all) of the Processing works aim more
  broadly with their problem solving. <em>In the Air</em> visualizes issues
  with Madrid’s air quality with the goal of growing collective awareness and
  spurring political action. <em>3D Printed Record</em> attempts to
  demonstrate and push the limits of 3D printing technology, and create
  accessible and recognizable 33rpm records. <em>Terrapattern</em> allows for
  the discovery of visual similarities across vast sets of satellite imagery,
  in the hope of fostering greater collective understanding of human
  activity. Each of these pieces focuses on what are essentially social
  issues: our treatment of the environment, the means of production, and
  collective understanding.
</p>
<p>
  That is not to say that all of the Processing works encompass such grand
  challenges, since some of them do not, but it is another demonstration of a
  shifted perspective from that of the Scratch artists. Where the Scratch
  pieces confront a personal issue presumably faced by the viewer, the
  Processing works, at least at times, consider an issue in terms of its
  societal ramifications. This is a critical difference in perspective, and
  worth further exploration to determine its definitive roots.
</p>

<h2 id="implications">
  Implications
</h2>

<p>
  From one perspective, creative coding offers a possible answer to the
  challenge of encouraging and supporting more diverse learners in computer
  science. From another, it is an avenue of <em>new </em>for new media, and
  represents a rapidly expanding sphere of artistic exploration between
  mediums linked through technology. Both perspectives offer us a glimpse at
  important and real change in the arts and the technology sector, driven by
  increased access and awareness of tools like Processing and Scratch.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Supporting more diverse learners</strong>
</p>
<p>
  In Chachra’s (2015) explanation for <em>The Atlantic</em> on why she is not
  a maker, she pointed to the issues around the valuation of “making” and who
  and what it leaves out. Chachra wrote that she was “uncomfortable with any
  culture that encourages you take on an entire identity, rather than to
  express a facet of your own identity.” Buechley (2013) exposed this same
  issue when she discovered the lack of minority representation on    <em>Make </em>magazine covers, and Resnick et al. (2009), the creators of
  Scratch, unearthed it when they spoke of making the “walls even wider” (p.
  63), raising the obvious next question of who those walls have been keeping
  out.
</p>
<p>
  This issue of cultural inclusivity as expressed through personal identity
  is an undercurrent linking all manner of problems in STEM fields.
  Processing and Scratch both exist to open these sectors to ignored and
  unsupported individuals; to be a “positive departure” (Reas &amp; Fry,
  2015) from the old ways of doing things. The question is of course, will
  they work?
</p>
<p>
  From my observations of 100 works across the two platforms I believe there
  is reason to be hopeful that these kinds of tools can reach new learners.
  The common appropriation of music by the Scratch artists implies a
  connection to outside interests and passions, and the ability to
  incorporate them into the programming environment. The tendencies of
  Processing artists to tackle concepts with real world equivalents and
  broach social issues suggests an engagement with life outside the digital
  realm. While these may only be the loose suggestions of what a more
  inclusive technology education looks like, the hints for something grander
  are there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Inclusivity, code, and community</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Further supporting creative coding’s ability to encourage and support more
  diverse learners are active projects like Chelly Jin’s Diversity with
  Code+Art (Figure 12), which exists to “highlight and inspire diversity
  amongst the art and code community through valuing representation and
  visibility of various identities” (Jin, 2017). Began during the course of
  this study, Diversity with Code+Art is supported by the group behind P5.js,
  the JavaScript offshoot of Processing, which is itself directly supported
  by the Processing Foundation.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
  This uninterrupted line from Processing to a project shining light on the
  work of Asian women and gender non-conforming artists exemplifies the
  purpose of the tool in the first place. It is also in keeping with one of
  the original goals of Processing: to allow artists to have “an easy way to
  share work with each other and understand each other’s ideas” (Maeda, 2009,
  p. 60). By sharing the stories and works of these artists online, Jin is
  adding their perspectives to the greater community narrative, and creating
  a more inclusive environment for future learners.
</p>
<p>
  To “understand each other’s ideas” as Maeda (2009, p. 60) wrote, takes on
  particularly important meaning in this context, where the “other” in
  computer science and technology are the very people whose experiences Jin
  (2017) is attempting to speak to. Understanding the ideas of others is not
  all that far a leap from better understanding <em>others</em> more
  generally, and considering viewpoints other than our own.
</p>
<p>
  The pursuit of Resnick et al. (2009) to make “the floor even lower and the
  walls even wider” (p. 63) for programming with Scratch is driven by the
  desire for greater inclusivity and ultimately understanding. The power of
  Scratch lies not in any technical innovation or clever hack, but in the bar
  to entry being lowered to the point where more than 18 million people can
  create with it, and even more importantly where more than 18 million people    <em>want</em> to.
</p>
<p>
  If creative coding tools like Scratch and Processing can attract diverse
  users and support their voices through sharing, remixing, and engaging with
  other people, then perhaps some of the wider issues of diversity in tech
  and the education pipeline feeding it can begin to mend. There is no silver
  bullet, but supporting the interests and passions of diverse learners is a
  vital step in the path to achieving true digital equity.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Building on the new in new media</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Beyond the concrete issue of accessibility in technology lies the more
  formless question of how creative coding impacts the work and experiences
  of artists. Creative coding tools like Processing and Scratch are
  undeniably new additions to the artist’s toolkit, but whether they
  represent the equivalent of merely a new sort of pigment or rather
  something more fundamentally different is a question yet to be fully
  answered.
</p>
<p>
  Burke &amp; Kafai (2010) dipped into this issue when they considered
  Scratch as a means to educate children on narrative and storytelling. What
  they discovered was that Scratch both supported traditional language arts
  concepts like plot, character development, and resolution, and re-worked
  the process of generating a story into a more iterative one. This kind of
  mutual support and blending of subjects repeats in Dasgupta &amp; Resnick’s
  (2014) research into crowd-sourced art projects, where both the canvas    <em>and</em> the underlying structure of the canvas were subject to
  creative experimentation.
</p>
<p>
  What Burke &amp; Kafai (2010) and Dasgupta &amp; Resnick (2014) uncovered
  was the gradually strengthening idea of creative coding as means to link
  traditionally distinct mediums. Programming with tools like Processing and
  Scratch allows for access to the structure of the digital medium itself,
  opening up links to all manner of other fields and concepts. Code can do
  things like tell stories, manipulate images, create music, interact with
  the physical world, and change endlessly over time; it is as much a medium
  as it is a language to link them.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Linking fields and remixing concepts</strong>
</p>
<p>
  In the 100 Processing and Scratch artworks observed for this study, the
  links between concepts and mediums appeared in a number of ways, from the
  consistent attachment of music to generated visuals, to the half of pieces
  exhibiting some form of interactivity and connection to real life
  phenomena. By drawing connections through different kinds of media and
  providing new layers of interactivity between them, the observed artworks
  demonstrated the ability to link often artistically disparate concepts,
  while also ascending into the murky realm of new media, and gaining the
  accompanying resistance to categorization.
</p>
<p>
  The prevalence of remixing, both in the observed artworks and the creative
  coding community as a whole, contributes to conceptual access between other
  fields. By providing an accurate means of copying and altering the work of
  others, either through an explicit remixing feature or through the sharing
  of code online, tools like Processing and Scratch allow for users to build
  off the knowledge of others in an incredibly direct fashion. Dasgupta,
  Hale, Monroy-Hernández, &amp; Hill (2016), in their look at remixing as a
  path to computational thinking, wrote that “one of the most important
  arguments made in favor of remixing is that it allows users to engage with
  material created by others with different skills, knowledge, and
  experiences” (p. 1). When that material stretches beyond the confines of
  mathematics, computer science, and technology, that suggests an essential
  strength of creative coding, and the share-everything community behind it.
  Rather than be confined to a single subject area or medium, creative coding
  appears to encourage engagement across disciplines, and by extension
  interests.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>
  The artworks being created and shared online with Processing and Scratch
  offer glimpses of a more inclusive future for both art and technology. By
  respecting a wider diversity of interests and economic circumstances,
  creative coding may avoid some of the cultural pitfalls of the maker
  movement, while supporting and encouraging greater participation by those
  traditionally disadvantaged and discriminated against in STEM education. At
  the same time, creative coding appears to foster new links between
  disciplines that are flexible and rapidly alterable in ways unique to the
  digital space. This suggests that not only might we be able to support a
  new generation of technologically adept youth, but a new generation of
  artists, with a more malleable conception of the boundaries between
  mediums.
</p>
<p>
  Maloney et al. (2008) found that Scratch reminded youth of the arts more
  than any other subject. The enormity and variety of the Processing and
  Scratch artworks available online corroborate this point, while offering
  further evidence of the potential in creative coding to reshape not only
  art and technology education, but simply education.

    P5.js, an offshoot of the original Processing codebase, is much more

    Processing requires an external library to work with sound, for example,
    and Scratch both lists Motion and Looks before Sound in the online editor
    and has more blocks for each of those categories.

    Processing’s support for Perlin noise (a technique for producing “natural”
